 Final Project – IBM Relational Database Administration Essentials

This repository contains the final project work completed as part of the IBM Relational Database Administration Essentials certification on Coursera.
The project is divided into three parts and demonstrates hands-on skills in managing relational databases using PostgreSQL, MySQL, and IBM Db2 across cloud and containerized environments.

Project Highlights:

Part 1 – PostgreSQL (Docker + Theia IDE):
Installation, configuration, user management, and database backup

Part 2 – MySQL (Docker + Theia IDE):
Recovery, indexing, storage engine setup, and automation of routine tasks

Part 3 – IBM Db2 (Cloud + Datasette):
Data restoration, index creation to improve performance, and view creation
All tasks were performed in live environments using command-line tools and SQL scripts. This project demonstrates core DBA responsibilities including provisioning, securing, optimizing,
and troubleshooting relational databases.
